##Overview

All roles defined for my own environment will be found here

##Module Description

This is my playground to doe some normal, wierd, and even unexpected things with the roles and profile concept.

##Setup

###What roles affects

All your nodes will be infected, misconfigured, broken etc. This module only fits my environment.  But feel free to use some of my crazy ideas.

###Setup Requirements

Experimented  on Puppet Enterprise 3.7.1

###Beginning with roles

google 'puppet roles and profiles' and start reading.

##Usage

The goal :  clissify only one, and just one role to your nodes.

##Reference

Google is your friend.

##Limitations

Maybe this will work too well, or even not ?  Use on your own risk.

##Development

Just file an issue, do PR, and most of all, be patient.

##Release Notes/Contributors/Etc
